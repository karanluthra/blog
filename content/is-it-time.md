Is it time, for me to close my eyes?
To use the switch, to turn it off?
Seems like the closing of the eyes,
would only trigger a tear to fall
Seems like, taking a breather,
would only make me regret the call

Is it time, to step aside?
To take the seat, and watch the game?
Seems like its a runway on tight schedule,
Take off, right now! Or else, dont blame.
Remind me of the player I wanted to be,
then anyone less, I wouldnt want to see!
