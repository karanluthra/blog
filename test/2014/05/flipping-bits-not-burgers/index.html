</footer><!-- /.post-info -->      <p>I wasn't even checking the results that night when I got a congratulatory email from a friend. There was nothing else one could be congratulated for on that night, except for GSoC results. As difficult as it was to believe I found it to be true that my proposal indeed got selected for the 10th <a href="http://www.google-melange.com/gsoc/homepage/google/gsoc2014">Google Summer of Code</a>, for the summers of 2014. I will be working under <a href="http://www.kde.org/">KDE</a> and my <a href="http://www.google-melange.com/gsoc/project/details/google/gsoc2014/luthrak/5685265389584384">proposal</a> aims to improve how <a href="http://trojita.flaska.net">Trojitá</a> sends email over SMTP and make it as robust and capable as the IMAP part, the USP of the email client. :D</p>
<p>My first contribution to Free and Open Source Software began with a <a href="http://quickgit.kde.org/?p=trojita.git&amp;a=commit&amp;h=6f14132d37666148e2db44be9e051816bb33daca">patch</a> for Trojitá in February. It was a feature request that I thought I could work on, and while it took me very long to bring the patch to the quality that could get it merged, it was a different high I experienced when I heard "Ship It!" for the first time in my life, and saw my name in the 'About Trojitá' menu of the email client I had started loving to use. </p>
<p><img alt="About Trojitá - List of Contributors" src="/images/trojita_authors.png" title="About Trojitá - List of Contributors" /></p>
<p>This is the reward of working with open source projects. You can imagine the impact your code can have on thousands (and millions? :D) of users and this motivates you to improve the patch each time it gets returned from a review by mentors. Another encouragement is that open source projects do not care about your exam scores, your university's reputation, or even your majors for that matter! I was thinking hard how to spend the summers after my final semester and before joining the job I have been offered through campus placement, and Google Summer of Code seemed like the dream option to me. However, I was never too sure about getting selected as I am not an experienced developer, so I kept exploring other options while planning to keep contributing to Trojitá at my own, slow pace. </p>
<p>The first thing I did on the morning after the results night, was clear all the bookmarked interships! I have cleared most of the distractions by now, and got another <a href="http://quickgit.kde.org/?p=trojita.git&amp;a=commit&amp;h=7708aaa7fda2877a868a542e9a1335683c9cbdb7">patch</a> submitted recently. I am still lagging behind schedule, but it's only going to get better from now :)</p>
<p>If you are even one bit curious about how Open Source projects, GSoC, or Computer Science outside your exam-syllabus works, then keep watching this space. I will try and blog as much as I can about all that I am upto :)</p>
<p>Cheers to the Summer of 2014! :D</p>
